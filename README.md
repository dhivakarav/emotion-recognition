🎭 Emotion Recognition System
AI-Powered Facial Expression Analysis

This project is a Python-based Emotion Recognition system that utilizes deep learning to identify human emotions from images or real-time video feeds. As a B.Tech CSE (AI & ML) student, I developed this to explore computer vision and neural network architectures.

🚀 Key Features
Real-time Detection: Identifies emotions (Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Neutral, etc.) via webcam integration.

Pre-trained Models: Leverages advanced architectures for high-accuracy facial landmark detection.

Data Processing: Includes custom scripts for image preprocessing and normalization.

Modular Code: Built with a clean Python structure for easy integration into other AI projects.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x

Libraries: OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy

Environment: Pyenv (for dependency management)

Deployment: GitHub Version Control

📐 How It Works
The system follows a three-stage pipeline:

Face Detection: Locates faces within a frame using Haar Cascades or MTCNN.

Feature Extraction: Processes the facial region to identify key expression markers.

Classification: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) predicts the emotion based on learned patterns.
